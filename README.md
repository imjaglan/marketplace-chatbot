# Next.js Marketplace with OpenAI Chatbot

This project is a Next.js-based marketplace application that includes an OpenAI Chatbot. The Chatbot is specifically designed to enhance user interactions within marketplaces and web/mobile applications focused on business operations.

## Features

The Chatbot offers the following features:

1. **Support Tickets**: Users can create support tickets through the Chatbot, enabling efficient communication between customers and support staff.

2. **Product Suggestions**: The Chatbot suggests products based on user queries, helping customers discover relevant items within the marketplace.

3. **How-To Assistance**: The Chatbot provides step-by-step instructions and guidance to customers, answering their "how to" queries related to the marketplace or application.

4. **Marketing Jokes**: The Chatbot can crack jokes related to marketing, adding a fun and engaging element to customer interactions.

## Future Scope

In the future, the project has potential for further enhancements and integrations. Some proposed features include:

1. **Image-Based Answering**: Leveraging ChatGpt 4, the Chatbot can support image-based queries and provide accurate responses. This enables customers to ask questions based on images, expanding the capabilities of the Chatbot.

2. **Customer Support with Images**: With ChatGpt 4, the Chatbot can assist customers by understanding and answering queries related to images. This enhances the customer support experience by enabling customers to share visual information and receive relevant assistance.

3. **Product Identification**: By utilizing image recognition capabilities, the Chatbot can identify products based on images shared by customers. This facilitates seamless search and discovery within the marketplace.

4. **Personalized Product Suggestions**: The Chatbot can analyze user activity and purchase history to provide personalized product recommendations. This enhances the user's shopping experience by offering relevant and tailored suggestions.

## Installation

To install and run the Next.js Marketplace with OpenAI Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo-link).

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Note:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

## Security Considerations

To ensure security and prevent misuse of the Chatbot, the following measure has been implemented:

1. **Response Limiter**: A response limiter of 3 seconds has been added between Chatbot responses. This prevents bots from misusing the Chatbot and helps mitigate the risk of incurring excessive fees associated with the ChatGpt 3.5 or 4 account.

It is important to review and enhance the security measures as per your specific requirements and the environment in which the application will be deployed.
